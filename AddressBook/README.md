# Address Book Project üìá

## Introduction
The Address Book project is a command-line application developed in Java that allows users to manage their contacts efficiently. It utilizes Java database connectivity (JDBC) to interact with a MySQL database, enabling users to add, view, update, and delete contacts.

## Project Schema üìã
The database schema for the project consists of a single table named `Contacts` with the following fields:
- `id`: Auto-incremented integer serving as the primary key.
- `name`: Variable-length string storing the name of the contact.
- `phone_number`: Variable-length string storing the phone number of the contact.
- `email`: Variable-length string storing the email address of the contact.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
The Address Book project functions as a command-line interface (CLI) application, providing users with a menu-driven interface to perform various operations on their contacts. Here's how it works:
1. **Adding Contacts**: Users can add new contacts by entering their name, phone number, and email address.
2. **Viewing Contacts**: Users can view all contacts, search for contacts by name, or retrieve contacts by their unique ID.
3. **Updating Contacts**: Users can update existing contacts by modifying their name, phone number, or email address.
4. **Deleting Contacts**: Users can delete contacts either by their unique ID or remove all contacts from the address book.

## Changes to Make üõ†Ô∏è
To adapt the project to your environment and preferences, you need to make the following changes:
- **Database Configuration**: Update the database connection URL, username, and password in the `App.java` file to connect to your MySQL database.
- **Project Customization**: Customize the project according to your requirements, such as modifying the database schema, refining the user interface, or adding additional functionalities.

## Getting Started üöÄ
To run the Address Book project on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure that you have MySQL installed and running on your system.
4. Create a new database named `Your_Database_Name` and execute the provided SQL script to create the `Contacts` table:- 
`CREATE TABLE Contacts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(15),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);`

5. Update the database connection details in the `App.java` file.
6. Build and run the project from your IDE.
